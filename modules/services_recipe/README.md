Services Recipe
======================

This recipe adds a content type and some views to managing and displaying 'services offered' by a digital agency or other organization.
This recipe was created as part of the Zeever theme project: https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/zeever/wiki

This recipe creates

 - A Services content type
 - A page view and a block view of services offered.
 - A menu item in main menu.

 While some users may be happy with the configuration of this Services feature 
 exactly as defined in the recipe. We expect that most users will use 
 this recipe as a starting point and customize it to meet their unique needs.
